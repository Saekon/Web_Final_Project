                        Staring into the dark abyss of a empty fridge. Feeling

                        throwing out food that could have been eaten, just if

                    <h3>I am a recent parent</h3>
                    <p>
                        With a child, there is a lot of things to think about
                        and different variety of food that I have to make.
                        Because of this, I lose track of time and the things I
                        havei n my fridge
                    </p>

                    <h3>I am between 20 and 30</h3>
                    <p>
                        Being young, I often eat outside and forget that I have
                        food in my fridge. Additionally, I donâ€™t think to much
                        about my spending, but it always hurts at the end of the
                        month

                    <h3>I am wealthy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Money is not my real motivation for taking more
                        responsibility towards my food consumption. Because of
                        this, I would rather think about how my habits can help
                        the environent.

                        By helping you manage your food usage and dates of
                        expiry, you can help support the UN goals by making
                        micro changes to your habits. Over time, this can have a
                        big impact on both your wallet, the environment and also
                        the society. Less waste is always better!
